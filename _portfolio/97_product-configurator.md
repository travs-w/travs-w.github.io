One of the biggest barriers to making a sale is customer confusion. If the customer isn't sure what they are getting or what they need, then they won't be buying it.

This <a href="https://magento.com/about"<a href="https://magento.com/about">Magento</a>>Magento</a> project was focused on a particularly customizable, but potentially confusing product line. By breaking down the product line into sections, the customer is able to focus on the particular components they need.

<div class="center">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/product-configurator.png" alt="" style="max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"/>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>
Many customer-oriented features are included to minimize complication and maximize efficiency.

<ul>
    <li>Show product description on hover</li>
    <li>Choose product options (color, size, etc.)</li>
    <li>Simple Next/Back interface</li>
    <li>Native quantity input with increase/decrease button</li>
    <li>Input checking to prevent errors or missing products</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_row center">
    <img class="col one" style="float: none;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/product-configurator-description.png" alt="" title="Intuitive description"/>
    <img class="col one" style="float: none;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/product-configurator-option.png" alt="" title="Choose options"/>
</div>

<br/>
Customers need only basic understanding of the product to be able to order even the most complex systems. Reduce confusiong, frustration and call volume, while increasing sales and customer satisfaction.
