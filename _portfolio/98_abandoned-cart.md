Every e-commerce site needs to be able to handle lost sales opportunities. One of the simplest ways to manage these opportunities is to provide a follow-up for visitors who <em>didn't</em> end up buying your products.

This <a href="https://magento.com/about" target="_blank">Magento</a> project had a simple goal: Use Magento's built-in Abandoned Cart tracking to follow-up with clients who may not have found what they were looking for.

<div class="img_row center">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/abandoned-cart.png" alt="" style="height: 100%;"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Nobody likes being left behind
</div>

<br/>
<br/>
With our goal in mind, I set out to keep things as simple as possible, while allowing flexibility to my client and their customers. A new section was added to the admin settings to allow my client to customize based on their needs.

<ul>
    <li>Sender Name &amp; Email</li>
    <li>How often to check for abandoned carts</li>
    <li>Email template to use</li>
</ul>

<div class="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/abandoned-cart-settings.png"><img src="/img/abandoned-cart-settings.png" alt="" style="max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"/></a>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>
Set it and forget it, folks! After configuring settings, just sit back and relax while Magento does the heavy lifting, turning lost sales into another opportunity for conversion.

<div class="center">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/abandoned-cart-log.png"><img src="/img/abandoned-cart-log.png" alt="" style="max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"/></a>
</div>
